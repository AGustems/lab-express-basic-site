            <h1>Panic! At The Disco</h1>
            <p>Panic! at the Disco is the solo project of American musician Brendon Urie, with drummer Dan Pawlovich,
                bassist
                Nicole Row, and guitarist Mike Naran accompanying him on tour.
                <br><br>
                Urie was born in St. George, Utah, and his family moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, when he was two years old.
                He
                is the fifth and youngest child born to Grace and Boyd Urie. He is of about one quarter Polynesian
                descent
                from Hawaii, through his mother's side. He was raised in an LDS family, but left the faith around 17 due
                to displeasure with the church and not believing in its ideology. Urie attended Palo Verde High
                School in Las Vegas, where he met future Panic! bassist Brent Wilson in his guitar class. Wilson asked
                Urie
                to try out for a band he was in, since they needed a replacement guitarist.

                Urie described himself as a "spaz in high school," and explained that one student would always bully
                him. He
                worked at Tropical Smoothie Cafe in order to pay his band's rent for their practice space. At the cafe,
                Urie
                often sang for customers. He explained, "I would sing anything I was listening to at the time, but I was
                down to
                take requests. I remember singing some Scorpions songs, some W.A.S.P. 80s anthems are usually good for
                tips.
                It
                was a huge range of stuff. Some people liked it, and some people didn't. I had to respect other people's
                wishes,
                but I had a couple people come in who would ask me to sing for a tip. That's always fun."
