            <h1>About the band</h1>
            <h3>Formation as rock band and early years</h3>
            <p>Panic! at the Disco was formed in 2004 in the suburban area of Summerlin, Las Vegas, by childhood friends
                Ryan
                Ross, who sang and played guitar, and Spencer Smith, who played drums. They both attended Bishop Gorman
                High
                School, and they began playing music together in ninth grade. They invited friend Brent Wilson from
                nearby
                Palo Verde High School to join on bass, and Wilson invited classmate Brendon Urie to try out on guitar.
                The
                quartet soon began rehearsing in Smith's grandmother's living room. Ross initially was the lead singer
                for
                the group, but after hearing Urie sing back-up during rehearsals, the group decided to make him the
                lead.
                Initially, Panic! at the Disco was a Blink-182 cover band.
                <br><br>
                The band, which aimed to sound different from the many death metal bands in Las Vegas, signed a
                recording
                contract without having performed a live show. Urie began working at Tropical Smoothie Cafe in Summerlin
                to
                afford rent for the band's new practice space. Urie has stated that he sang for tips during his time
                working, thus indicating he had some prestige as a singer. The four left their educations behind to
                concentrate
                on music; Ross had a falling out with his father when he dropped out of college, and when Urie dropped
                out
                of
                high school his parents kicked him out of the house.
                <br><br>
                Ross and Urie sent a demo to Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz via a LiveJournal account. Wentz, who was
                in
                Los
                Angeles at the time with the rest of Fall Out Boy working on the band's major-label debut, From Under
                the
                Cork
                Tree, drove to Las Vegas to meet with the young, unsigned band. Upon hearing "two to three" songs during
                band practice, Wentz was impressed and immediately wanted the band to sign to his Fueled by Ramen
                imprint
                label
                Decaydance Records, which made the band the first on the new label. Around December 2004, the group
                signed
                to
                the label.[9] As news broke that Wentz had signed Panic! (who had yet to perform a single live show),
                fans
                on
                the internet began to bash the group. "Almost right away we knew what was going to happen," Ross
                explained
                in a
                2006 interview. "We had two songs online and people were already making assumptions on what kind of band
                we
                were
                and what we were going to sound like."
                <br><br>
                Meanwhile, Wentz began to hype the band wherever possible: from wearing "Pete! at the Disco" T-shirts
                onstage to
                mentioning the group in interviews. Wentz gave a quick shout-out to the band during a press junket on
                the
                day
                before the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards: "I've got a couple of bands coming out soon on Decaydance, one
                being
                this band called Panic! at the Disco," Wentz said. "Their record is going to be your next favorite
                record.
                It's
                called A Fever You Can't Sweat Out – get it before your little brother does." At the time of the band's
                signing, all of the band members were still in high school (with the exception of Ross, who was forced
                to
                quit
                UNLV). Urie graduated in May 2005, and Wilson and Smith finished school online as the band left for
                College
                Park, Maryland, to record their debut record.</p>

            <h3>Musical style and influences</h3>
            <p> Panic! at the Disco have been known to change their sound each album. Musically, they have mainly been
                described
                as pop rock, pop, pop punk, baroque pop, electropop, synth-pop, dance-punk,power pop, alternative
                rock,emo
                pop,vaudeville, and emo.
                <br><br>
                Panic! at the Disco went on record many times saying that the group's second album would be completely
                different
                from A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, as Rolling Stone wrote in an article: "The group cemented its next
                direction
                with their first single, called "Nine in the Afternoon." "It's influenced by the music our parents
                listened
                to:
                the Beach Boys, the Kinks, the Beatles," says Ross. "Our new songs are more like classic rock than
                modern
                rock.
                We got older and started listening to different music – and this seems like the natural thing to do
                right
                now." Pretty. Odd. has been described as being like "[Panic] dropping the entire Beatles catalog into a
                blender, adding some modern alternative ice and the horn section from Sonia Dada, then churning out a
                new-millennium Liverpool smoothie." In his review of the band's live album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine
                noted,
                "...Pretty. Odd. suggests that they're becoming that rare thing in 2008: a pop-oriented rock band. They
                might
                not be doing this knowingly, but the results are entertaining all the same."[124] Urie has cited
                bands/artists
                such as Frank Sinatra, Queen, David Bowie, Weezer, Green Day and My Chemical Romance as his biggest
                influences.</p>
